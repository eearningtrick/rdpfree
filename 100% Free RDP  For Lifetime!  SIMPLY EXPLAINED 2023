RDP: THE BASICS

Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides remote input also output and display capabilities several network connections for Windows and macbook-based applications running on a server.




RDP CONNECTION

We will simply explain the basics part of an RDP connection. Note that for the sake of simplicity, some details have been omitted. For more information -

CONNECTION SEQUENCE

he RDP connection can be divided into several stages: (see Connection Sequence )

Initiation of the Connection (Connection Initiation)
Basic Settings Exchange
Channel Connection
Beginning of Security (Security Commencement)
Secure Settings Exchange
License
Capabilities Exchange
Termination of the Connection (Connection Finalization)
Data Exchange
2-CONNECTION INITIATION



Standard RDP security

Default RSA RC4 encryption

Enhanced RDP security

TLS
CredSSP (TLS + NTLM/Kerberos)
RDSTLS – RDP enhanced with TLS
3-CHANNEL CONNECTION
MCS Erect Domain Request – Height in the MCS domain. Since RDP does not take advantage of advanced MCS topologies, it will be 0.
MCS Attach User Request – request for a user channel ID
MCS Attach User Confirm – User Channel ID
(+5) MCS Channel Join Requests and Confirmations
4-CONNECTION FINALIZATION

Client/Server Synchronize PDU

Client/Server Control PDU (Cooperate)

Persistent Key List PDU/PDUs (optional)

Font List/Map PDU

5-STATIC VIRTUAL CHANNELS (SVCS)

Examples of SVCs created by default:

I/O channel
Message Channel
User Channel
Server Channel
6-DYNAMIC VIRTUAL CHANNELS (DVC)
